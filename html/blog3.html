        <h2>Semantic Markup - What is it and Why is it necessary.</h2>
        <br>
            <p>The way we go about writing the structure of our HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) file is an important factor to consider. Semantics refers to the correct interpretation of the meaning of a word or sentence. Semantic Markup refers to a specific way of going about this structure that reinforces the meaning of the content over the appearance of the content. An instance of good practice is separating the presentation of content from the content("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). This is done by having the file structure and content as part of your HTML and having the presentation of that content part of your CSS. Semantic Markup is built to facilitate accessibility which should be at the heart of the HTML design but is useless if not implemented correctly. We should use HTML elements the way they are supposed to be used. To begin writing with semantic markup we first have to understand the hierarchy of our content. We have to consider how the user will read it and how the machine will read it. The purpose of this is to make it easier for browsers, developers, and web crawlers to distinguish between different types of data. The semantic tags used such as "section", "article", "footer", "nav", and "aside" make it clear to the browsers, developers, and web crawlers what information on the webpage is important. ("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). Using "div" does not provide information to the search engines and will hinder the accessibility of your webpage. Instead of your webpage being displayed on the first page of google, it will turn up on the 10th page. This is because web crawlers cannot read the content, so even if your webpage is the most relevant to what is being searched, it possibly would never be accessed ("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). If we used semantic markup in this case the computer would understand the content and display the content on the first page. Semantic markup "article" for instance provides a clear section and a logical flow to the hierarchy, contrary to this, "div" does not, rather itâ€™s sections are ambiguous and there is no hierarchy("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). 
The 2 overarching factors of using semantic markup is accessibility and maintenance. As web applications grow rich and creative they become less accessible to people with disabilities, semantic markup is used to ensure equal access to people with disabilities. This also benefits people without disabilities by allowing them to customize their experience("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). 2nd, Semantic markup results in clear standardize code which allows developers to save time in the long run. Clear code is easy to maintain and allows for a different developer to work on the code without confusion.
