        <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
        <br>
            <p>With the spike in popularity of the world wide web there has been an increase of awareness in the powerful, malleable hyperlink networks.  Previously, views on hyperlinks barely glimpsed the extent to which they can express meaning. Theoretically hyperlinks reflect deep social and cultural structures(Tsui & Turow, 2020). The newfound understanding has changed the way hyperlinks are used and exploited. Since hyperlinks are easily manipulated and the use and understanding 10 years ago is different to the use and understanding today, they will leak into our social lives. This in turn means that hyperlinks need to be understood as far more then linking an article to your webpage. When we think of hyperlinks the first idea of a hyperlink is a link or reference word/image that when clicked-on automatically takes us to a particular webpage that has associated information to the link.
                We cannot identify the origin of the hyperlink, the reason being is that hyperlinks are simple enough to be applicable to a spectrum of technologies(Tsui & Turow, 2020). Hyperlinks are not limited to a particular medium, they are simply automatic citation devices, but there are precursors to what we generally think of as a hyperlink. Today, documents are not always in a digital format and definitely were not in a digital format back in the day. Prior to hyperlinks, quotations and citations can  be argued to have a similar function to what hyperlinks were thought to be, of course this has changed as previously mentioned. Despite this change, there will always be a relationship between a traditional citation and the development of the hyperlink(Tsui & Turow, 2020). The function of a citation on the surface appears obvious but it is not as obvious as it may appear. We generally think of a citation as presenting other ideas, often as support for our own argument, on top of this it is also a way of “assuming access to a generalized pool of authoritative text and avoid recapitulating the development of an entire field” (Tsui & Turow, 2020, p3). In this case it serves a role of pointing a reader to helpful resources that coincide with the topic at hand(Tsui & Turow, 2020). Other reasons for linking previous work: criticize, analyze, build, or refute that work, without effective citations scholarly work would remain solitary work rather than the textual conversation it is. Due to this, ‘citation’ is acknowledged to be “hyperconversation” as it occurs across both context and time. 
                The term hyperlink and hypertext are terms coined by Nelson, who set out to create a broadly associative way of organizing knowledge in his project Xanadu(Tsui & Turow, 2020). The problem was that the hyperlinks were used in a unidirectional way and was unable to reflect the rich associated thought. With the introduction of the world wide web the significance has expanded and changed, the role of the link is beyond citation and if now set on navigational issues. “Clicking a hyperlink may lead to a camera changing its orientation, to a book being ordered and sent through the mail, to an e-mail in-box being reorganized, or to a closer view of a satellite image. These potential uses were not outside of the expectations of some of the originators of the hyperlink” (Tsui & Turow, 2020, p6). As a result, hyperlinks provide an opportunity to understand social behaviour and the important role in the development of social knowledge. Hyperlinks can be best understood within the context of a hyperlink network. This is because hyperlinks alone cannot cause a shift but the network used with the hyperlink allows the shift, it like clicking on a youtube video with no internet connect, “the video will not play”. 
                Hyperlinks at its core is essentially text. The only difference occurs in that they can be interpreted as a kind of control language, providing organization, coordination and structure. “Hyperlinks form the basis for this learning, adaptive, self-aware social system” (Tsui & Turow, 2020, p15). If we look at the time lapse of the hyperlink we will see the ever increasing role it plays in our interaction(Tsui & Turow, 2020).
