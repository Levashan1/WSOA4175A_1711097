                <h3>Rationale:</h3>
                <p>My webpage is an expression of me and my creativity. It follows a vibrant cyber punk theme contrary to the general convention of websites being bland and monotoned. In my design I wanted to break this set convention while making a functional website that is easy to navigate. While it will be easy to navigate, each section of the website should feel like its own. The way navigation takes place in each section should look and feel different, the exception being the navigation elements on the top of the screen which is displayed the same on every page with the same functionality. The reason for this is to keep the general aesthetic of the website throughout the website. All navigation elements have a distinctive look and colour way that draws attention to it. All colours used are the same as or a variant of the colours apparent in the background image of the navigation, this image also sets the tone of the website. An additional navigation button appears on every page when a user scrolls down the page, this button allows users to go straight back to the top, this accommodates a satisfactory user experience. All navigation elements have feedback that communicate to the user that it is interactable. For my choice in font I went with something that is thin, clean, and easily readable that suits the neon cyber punk theme. The font is meant to look like text we see on neon billboards in places like Tokyo or Hong Kong. The font I will be using is ‘Text Me One’, part of the sans-serif font-family. This font will only be for the headings and navigation text. For paragraphs I plan on using something more generic like ‘Quicksand’ as it is easy to read in large chunks and does not look overwhelming like the ‘Text Me One’ font.
