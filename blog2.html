        <h2>Semantic Markup - What is it and Why is it necessary.</h2>
        <br>
            <p>The way we go about writing the structure of our HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) file is an important factor to consider. Semantics refers to the correct interpretation of the meaning of a word or sentence. Semantic Markup refers to a specific way of going about this structure that reinforces the meaning of the content over the appearance of the content. An instance of good practice is separating the presentation of content from the content ("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). This is done by having the file structure and content as part of your HTML and having the presentation of that content part of your CSS. Semantic Markup is built to facilitate accessibility which should be at the heart of the HTML design but is useless if not implemented correctly. We should use HTML elements the way they are supposed to be used. To begin writing with Semantic Markup we first must understand the hierarchy of our content. We must consider how the user will read it and how the machine will read it. The purpose of this is to make it easier for browsers, developers, and web crawlers to distinguish between different types of data. The semantic tags used such as "section", "article", "footer", "nav", and "aside" make it clear to the browsers, developers, and web crawlers what information on the webpage is important. ("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). Using "div" does not provide information to the search engines and will hinder the accessibility of your webpage. Instead of your webpage being displayed on the first page of google, it will turn up on the 10th page. This is because web crawlers cannot read the content, so even if your webpage is the most relevant to what is being searched it would never be accessed ("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). Semantic Markup "article" for instance provides a clear section and a logical flow to the hierarchy, contrary to this, "div" does not, rather it’s sections are ambiguous and there is no hierarchy("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). 
            The 2 overarching factors of using semantic mark-up is accessibility and maintenance. As web applications grow rich and creative, they become less accessible to people with disabilities, semantic mark-up is used to ensure equal access to people with disabilities. This also benefits people without disabilities by allowing them to customize their experience ("Semantic HTML for Meaningful Webpages", 2020). 2nd, Semantic Markup results in clear standardize code which allows developers to save time in the long run. Clear code is easy to maintain and allows for a different developer to work on the code without confusion.

    <h2>The Relevance of Vannevar Bush’s theory “As We May Think” to the design of the User Interface in computer technologies.</h2>
    <br>
        <p>Humans understand things through their connection to other things. 
            The word chair has no meaning without its connection to the physical object, this is the abstraction of information that is produced through a link between the signifier, which is the term or symbol that holds the meaning (word “chair”), and the signified, the meaning (physical “chair” (physical or conceptual)). 
            If we think about a “chair” our mind also trails to things that we associate with it, like the texture, style or desk that we can relate to a “chair”, which has no limits.
            If our mind drifted off to another concept, trails associated with “chair” would fade. Vannevar Bush was concerned with how the computer interface could help, he suggests that the human cognitive and interactive processes are far superior to that of the interactions and presentation of data produced by the computer. 
            In that case the computer should adapt to accommodate human needs not the other way around (Harper, 2010). 
            The reason why I am linking Vannevar Bushes theory is because 60+ years later and his theory is more relevant today than it ever was. 
            Today we see his theory in practice when we search the web, for instance you search “bleached hair” on the web, not only will there be images related to “bleached hair” but their will be video tutorials on how to bleach your hair, studies on how bleach damages hair and how to make your bleached hair healthy again, you get the point(Harper, 2010).
            This algorithm follows a similar concept to what Vannevar Bush theorized how a computer should adapt to the needs of the human. 
            Similarly, Simon Harper who wrote an article on Vannevar Bushes theory titled “As We May Think at 65” states that, “the human mind operates by association and as the mind grasps onto one item it naps to the next that is suggested by association of thought in accordance with some intricate web of trails”(Harper, 2010). 
            Keeping that in mind, algorithms that are now developed for the web are trying to replicate this cognitive flow by categorizing information and linking them by any connections or relevance to each other(Harper, 2010).
            The future of the web will succeed the theory presented by Vannevar Bush and web trails of relevant information as effective and the human mind itself. </p>

    <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
    <br>
        <p>With the spike in popularity of the world wide web there has been an increase of awareness in the powerful, malleable hyperlink networks.  Previously, views on hyperlinks barely glimpsed the extent to which they can express meaning. Theoretically hyperlinks reflect deep social and cultural structures(Tsui & Turow, 2020). The newfound understanding has changed the way hyperlinks are used and exploited. Since hyperlinks are easily manipulated and the use and understanding 10 years ago is different to the use and understanding today, they will leak into our social lives. This in turn means that hyperlinks need to be understood as far more then linking an article to your webpage. When we think of hyperlinks the first idea of a hyperlink is a link or reference word/image that when clicked-on automatically takes us to a particular webpage that has associated information to the link.
            We cannot identify the origin of the hyperlink, the reason being is that hyperlinks are simple enough to be applicable to a spectrum of technologies(Tsui & Turow, 2020). Hyperlinks are not limited to a particular medium, they are simply automatic citation devices, but there are precursors to what we generally think of as a hyperlink. Today, documents are not always in a digital format and definitely were not in a digital format back in the day. Prior to hyperlinks, quotations and citations can  be argued to have a similar function to what hyperlinks were thought to be, of course this has changed as previously mentioned. Despite this change, there will always be a relationship between a traditional citation and the development of the hyperlink(Tsui & Turow, 2020). The function of a citation on the surface appears obvious but it is not as obvious as it may appear. We generally think of a citation as presenting other ideas, often as support for our own argument, on top of this it is also a way of “assuming access to a generalized pool of authoritative text and avoid recapitulating the development of an entire field” (Tsui & Turow, 2020, p3). In this case it serves a role of pointing a reader to helpful resources that coincide with the topic at hand(Tsui & Turow, 2020). Other reasons for linking previous work: criticize, analyze, build, or refute that work, without effective citations scholarly work would remain solitary work rather than the textual conversation it is. Due to this, ‘citation’ is acknowledged to be “hyperconversation” as it occurs across both context and time. 
            The term hyperlink and hypertext are terms coined by Nelson, who set out to create a broadly associative way of organizing knowledge in his project Xanadu(Tsui & Turow, 2020). The problem was that the hyperlinks were used in a unidirectional way and was unable to reflect the rich associated thought. With the introduction of the world wide web the significance has expanded and changed, the role of the link is beyond citation and if now set on navigational issues. “Clicking a hyperlink may lead to a camera changing its orientation, to a book being ordered and sent through the mail, to an e-mail in-box being reorganized, or to a closer view of a satellite image. These potential uses were not outside of the expectations of some of the originators of the hyperlink” (Tsui & Turow, 2020, p6). As a result, hyperlinks provide an opportunity to understand social behaviour and the important role in the development of social knowledge. Hyperlinks can be best understood within the context of a hyperlink network. This is because hyperlinks alone cannot cause a shift but the network used with the hyperlink allows the shift, it like clicking on a youtube video with no internet connect, “the video will not play”. 
            Hyperlinks at its core is essentially text. The only difference occurs in that they can be interpreted as a kind of control language, providing organization, coordination and structure. “Hyperlinks form the basis for this learning, adaptive, self-aware social system” (Tsui & Turow, 2020, p15). If we look at the time lapse of the hyperlink we will see the ever increasing role it plays in our interaction(Tsui & Turow, 2020).
