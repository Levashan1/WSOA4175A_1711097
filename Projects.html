        <p>This is the most successful game we made. It’s a sci-fi themed fighting game, it relies on twitch skill and reaction time. It might be bluntly obvious from the theme of this website that  I love the cyberpunk/sci-fi theme, as it’s a theme also common in some of my games. This game was made by Mahlaste, Rugare, Kamo and I. I was the lead designer, assistant programmer and in charge of UI/UX. Mahlaste was the lead programmer. Rugare made the vfx, modeled the character, textures and cleaned up the animations I made. Kamo made the environment. </p>

        <p>This game focused on building a character controller. The goal of this game was to simulate the floaty movement mechanics of the old Quake games. During this game I also focused a lot on level design, making sure that there was interleading doors in every area to give players a way to always escape the overwhelming number of enemies. This was only the first time working with non-player characters, thus their behaviour was limited. The object of the game was to see how many kills a player could get to set the high score, the game was made for a 5-10 min playtime, so it progresses rapidly. Although my gameplay does not look overwhelming, no play testers managed to score above 60 kills. The difficulty in the game is progressive because players start with all their weapons and as they progress, they lose weapons. finally, if they break the 50 kill mark they left with only a pistol.  </p>

            <br>
            <p>Blambo was the first time working with 3d models. In this Exam we were required to build a scene, all the assets except for Blambo and robot were made by me. In addition to rigging, animating and texturing Blambo we used lighting, post processing and made the particle system play different particle effects depending on the object being shot. The sound was a bonus.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Dual invaders: The second digital game I ever made. For this project we were required to reproduce space invaders as a multiplayer game. This could be done with our own artistic expression if the core fundamentals of space invader remained.  In this mini game we were learning and putting into practice theory surrounding digital games. This theory revolved around terms like mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. There was also a high emphasis on feedback both visual and auditory. After programming the game, I played around with the feel, making the game responsive and adding adequate visual and sound effects. </p>

           <br>
            <p>Break out is the first digital game I ever made, it not pretty but it holds a lot of sentimental value. At the point of making this game I had no prior experience with programming, nor did I know how to use the Unity engine. I was given the task to make breakout and I did it the most absurd way. Depending on where the ball hit the paddle, the paddle would add force to the ball. This made the gameplay predictable, so to counter this, I add rand velocity after the ball hits certain objects. This game truly become on of reflex.  </p>

        <br>
        <p>The prompt of this game was to recreate an old experience. Group members: Deen, Robyn, Suna and I decide to re-create the feeling of going on a road trip. For this game I was the artist, I made the 3d props inside the car, did the post processing, the layout and animations in the scene. Suna was the programmer, Deen made the car, edited the music and worked with Robyn to do the voice overs. Robin also made the mom and dad models in the car.   </p>

            <br>
            <p>The prompt for this game was to re-create the experience of going to a carnival. Everyone thinks about different aspects of a carnival, maybe the food or rides, but the first thing that came to mind were the impossible carnival games I sucked at. So why not make a digital version of a game that I would always win at. I decided to make a carnival shooting prototype and I loved it. </p>

            <br>
            <p>The prompt was to recreate a part of an existing game; This prototype is based on the game The First Tree.  The prototype recreates the way the game communicates it narrative through the interactable objects that play dialogue. The First Tree is a beautiful game made with a few free assets from the Unity asset store. Although I would not consider the environment breathe taking, the narrative surely is. Its about a man who is reminiscing on past life choices and relationships, what is really powerful is the narrative being told through the interaction with a fox losing her cubs. PlayingWhen playing through the narrative it provides the player an experience like no other. In this game we trying to recreate that experience. This prototype was made by Josh, Fuzo, Deen and I. I was the lead designer; I also made the environment excluding the props and wrote the narrative. Josh made and animated the dog, Deen did the sound, Fuzo made some of the assets.   </p>

            <h3>Turn Based System</h3>

           <br>
            <p>This was a prototype made to work using turn-based game mechanics. This was the first game I found technically difficult at the time. This game was made in 2018. The prompt was to make a turned based game, the only turned based game I played were card games. At the time I felt that I would not have enough time to come up with and digitalize a card game. Therefore, I kept it simple and focused on making a turn-based system and adding shooting mechanics. I consider this the game I dislike the most from the games I’ve made. </p>
